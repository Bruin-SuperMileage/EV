 MPL3115A2 Barometric Pressure Sensor Library Example Code

 SparkFun Electronics
 Date: September 24th, 2013
 License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).
 
 This example coverts pressure from Pascals to inches of mercury, altimeter setting adjusted.
 This type of pressure reading is used in the USA on Wunderground. I find it SUPER weird, but it
 is needed for home weather stations and aircraft.
 
 You must set the correct altitude (station_elevation_m) below. Find this altitude using
 a GPS unit such as your cell phone. Be sure to put the elevation into meters (1meter = 0.3048ft).
 
 Hardware Connections (Breakoutboard to Arduino):
 -VCC = 3.3V
 -SDA = A4 (use inline 10k resistor if your board is 5V)
 -SCL = A5 (use inline 10k resistor if your board is 5V)
 -INT pins can be left unconnected for this demo
 
 During testing, GPS with 9 satellites reported 5393ft, sensor reported 5360ft (delta of 33ft). Very close!
