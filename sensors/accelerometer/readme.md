The accelerometer allows us to measure acceleration in the x, y, z directions. 
This code provides users with the x, y, z values of acceleration, as well as the magnitude of acceleration, in either raw ADC values or in g's.
To convert to SI units (m/s^2), simply multiply the sensor value by g (9.81 m/s^2).
