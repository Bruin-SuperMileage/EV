/*
Tachometer using micros

On this sketch we are going to measure the period between pulses using the micros() function to get the RPM
(Revolutions Per Minute) from a sensor on pin 2.
This way of measuring RPM makes it accurate, responsive and versatile. No matter how fast or slow the loop is
running, the reading accuracy is not going to be affected. Although, the faster you run the loop, the more amount
of readings you are going to be able to display every second.

It's coded in a way that the micros rollover doesn't create glitches every 71 minutes, so it can run forever
without problems.

We use an interrupt for the input so you have to choose pin 2 or 3 (for Arduino Uno/nano). In this example we
use pin 2.

This sketch was made for my video tutorial shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2uJMJWsfsg
